# Problem Statement

We have all wasted our precious time by constantly visiting banks and not getting the solutions for our queries. Often, when we apply for a loan, we have to wait for a long time to get a response from the bank if our loan is approved or not. This results in numerous visits to the bank and wastage of time. Therefore, to ease out the process of whether our loan can be approved or not we created FINWALLET. This app will help the user to predict if their loan application is going to be approved or not. There are various parameters which influence the userâ€™s chances to demand for a loan.  This application also consists of various features like showing finance news to help the user get regular updates , a WhatsApp BOT for helping the user.
